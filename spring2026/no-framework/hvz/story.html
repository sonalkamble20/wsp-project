                <h2>Chapter 1: The Outbreak</h2>
                <p>
                    In the year 2024, a mysterious virus spread across the globe without warning. 
                    Scientists struggled to understand its origin - was it natural, engineered, or something else entirely? 
                    Within weeks, millions were infected. The infected showed signs of aggressive behavior, sensitivity to light, 
                    and an insatiable hunger. They were no longer human. They were something... other.

                <h2>Chapter 2: The Fall</h2>
                <p>
                    Governments collapsed as the infection spread faster than any containment efforts could handle. 
                    Military forces were overwhelmed. Cities fell overnight. Survivors retreated to fortified positions - 
                    farms, military bases, and urban strongholds. Humanity was pushed to the brink of extinction. 
                    Society as we knew it was gone.

                <p>
                    The survivors learned to fight back. They developed weapons, strategies, and fortifications. 
                    They learned the patterns of the undead - they hunt in packs, they fear fire, and they are stronger in darkness. 
                    But the zombies also evolved. They became smarter, coordinated, and deadly. What once seemed like a mindless horde 
                    now had frightening intelligence.

                <h2>Chapter 4: The Long War</h2>
                <p>
                    Years have passed. The world is a wasteland of battlefields and zombie territories. 
                    Humans hold strategic positions across the globe, but zombies outnumber them 100 to 1. 
                    Every day is a struggle for survival. Every night brings new threats. 
                    The question is no longer "Will humanity survive?" but "Who will be standing when the dust finally settles?"

                    You are a survivor in this new world. Will you fight to reclaim humanity's future? 
                    Or will you embrace the infection and join the undead in their conquest? 
                    Your choices matter. Your actions shape the outcome of this eternal conflict. 
                    Join either side and determine the fate of the world.
